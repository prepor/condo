Condo is a simple idempotent supervisor for Docker containers. It can be used as a basic brick to build reliable and declarative systems without complex and smart schedulers like Kubernetes, but in combination with tools like [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy), [Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template), and [Registrator](https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator).

## Features

* Watches directories and starts a Docker container for each specification inside them.
* Reacts to any changes in these directories and specifications therein (adding, removing and updating of specifications).
* Zero downtime deployments with `:After` option enabled. It starts a new container *in parallel* with the old one, and stops the old one only after the new one is successfully started (including health checks).
* Supports the health check feature of Docker (from `1.12`). It considers a container `Stable` only when the health checks are passed.
* Manages its own persistent state. You can `kill -9` condo and start it again, everything will be fine.
* Exposes its state into an external storage (e.g. [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)). It can be used for monitoring of the entire system, higher level orchestration, etc.
* Understands Docker authentification config file (usually `~/.docker/config.json`).
* Provides http-endpoint to track the deployment status of a service (`/v1/wait_for`).
* Nice UI for exploring the state of current daemon and the entire system (if state exposing is enabled). TODO: it's broken now
* Container specification is fully opaque for condo, it has the same format as [Docker's remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#create-a-container), so there is no additional point of indirection and you can use all of Docker's features (even unreleased).
* Self-bootstrapping and updating. It can even deploy itself!

## Quickstart

Condo is compiled into native code, but the primary distribution method is Docker, of course.

Note: you can always see help by executing `docker run prepor/condo:v0.10.1 --help`

Condo uses [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) format to describe specifications. It's a human and machine readable format, with comments, and it's extendable.

Let's start nginx with condo:

    mkdir -p /tmp/condo_specs && echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.4-alpine"}}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    docker run -v /tmp/condo_specs:/var/lib/condo -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti prepor/condo:v0.10.1

You will see `Wait` -> `Stable` log messages. It means that our container has successfully started.

Now we will try to deploy a new version of this image:

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:oops-alpine"} :deploy [:After 5]}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    
Oops, there is a typo and we have an error: `Tag oops-alpine not found in repository`. The current state now is `TryAgainNext`. Condo will try to deploy this spec until it is successful or until a new specification arrives. Note that we still have `nginx:1.11.4-alpine` running – that's because we've specified the `:deploy [:After 5]` option, and the new container tries to start in parallel with the previous one.

Let's fix the typo:

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"} :deploy [:After 5]}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    
Yep, now it's deployed, the previous container was stopped.

That's basically the core functionality of condo ;)

## Specification format

Condo watches for `*.edn` files in all directories defined as PREFIXes via command line interface.

It has only one required parameter: `:spec`. It contains Docker container description in the format of [Docker's remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#create-a-container).
The only required field inside this description is `:Image`.

`:spec` is extended by the `:Name` parameter (name of the container).

Optional parameters:
* `:deploy` (default `[:Before]`). Can be `[:Before]` or `[:After n]` where `n` is the number of seconds before stopping the previous container after the successful start of the new one.
* `:health-timeout` in seconds (default 10). It describes how long condo will wait for the health checks to pass.
* `:stop-timeout` in seconds (default 10). It will be passed into `stop` Docker operation. It describes how long it will wait before force-stopping the container.
  
## HTTP API

See [How it works](https://github.com/prepor/condo#how-it-works) for definition of state.

* `/v1/state` – current state of all instances as json.
* `/v1/global_state` – current state of all condo instances (if state exposing into external storage is configured).
* `/v1/wait_for` – wait for the stable state of a service in all condo instances.
  Query params: 
  * `name` – the name of the service;
  * `timeout` – how long to wait in seconds. Returns 500 after `timeout`;
  * `image` – which image we are waiting for.

## Real world setups

There are some examples of combining condo with other tools. It proceeds
our Quickstart section.

### consul-template

https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template

We can use Consul Template to generate specifications. One of the nicest properties of this is that we can store current version of the container inside Consul and dynamically change it for all instances.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:{{key_or_default "/versions/nginx" "1.11.5-alpine"}}"} :deploy [:After 5]}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn.ctmpl

    echo '{:spec {:Name "consul" :Image "consul:v0.7.0"
                  :Cmd ["agent" "-dev" "-client=0.0.0.0"]
                  :HostConfig {:PortBindings {"8500/tcp" [{:HostPort "8500"}]}}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/consul.edn

    echo '{:spec {:Image "prepor/consul-template:0.16.0"
                  :Cmd ["-consul" "consul:8500"
                        "-template" "/specs/nginx.edn.ctmpl:/specs/nginx.edn"]
                  :HostConfig {:Binds ["/tmp/condo_specs:/specs/"]
                               :Links ["consul:consul"]}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/consul_template.edn
         
Now we can deploy nginx via `curl`! ;)

    curl -XPUT localhost:8500/v1/kv/versions/nginx -d '1.11.4-alpine'

We can add this line, for example, to CI, and both deploy and undeploy new versions of application manually or automatically.

You can also do service discovery via ENV variables or support HA PostgreSQL with [Patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni).

### nginx-proxy

https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy

Our nginx instances don't expose any ports into host machine, that's why we can run them in parallel while deploying. With nginx-proxy, we can expose one static port for them.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"
                  :Env ["VIRTUAL_HOST=nginx"]} :deploy [:After 5]}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
          
    echo '{:spec {:Image "jwilder/nginx-proxy:0.4.0"
           :Env ["DEFAULT_HOST=nginx"]
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock"]
                        :PortBindings {"80/tcp" [{:HostPort "8000"}]}}}}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/proxy.edn 
          
Now `curl localhost:8000` sends requests to currently deployed container.

### Registrator

https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator

Docker Registrator registers containers as service in different service discovery registries, such as Consul.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"
                  :HostConfig {:PublishAllPorts true}} :deploy [:After 5]}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
          
    echo '{:spec {:Image "gliderlabs/registrator:v7"
           :Cmd ["consul://localhost:8500"]
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock"]
                        :NetworkMode "host"}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/registrator.edn 
         
It will register nginx-service which starts at a random port in Consul. Now this information can be used by some external load balancer.
 
## Self-deploying

Condo supports special specification file -- `self.edn`. After it is updated, condo suspends all other updates and starts a new container with this specification, and after that gracefully stops itself.

Be careful, the format of this specification is different, because it contains only Docker container specification (which usually resides inside `:spec` keyword).

Example: 

    echo '{:Image "prepor/condo:v0.10.1"
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
                                "/tmp/condo_specs:/var/lib/condo"]}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/self.edn


## Best practices

* Define health checks. Without them, condo considers a container successfully started even if it crashed in a second.
* Use restart strategies. Condo stops monitoring a container after it successfully started. But Docker daemon does. You can restart containers by `:RestartPolicy` option of `HostConfig`, for example `:RestartPolicy {:Name "on-failure"}`.
  
## How it works

One of the main reasons why condo exists is because a deployment tool should be simple and understandable by all users. I am not sure if anyone really knows what Kubernetes does in each case (1,500,000 lines of code by the way!). Condo is basically a simple state machine for each service:

![Fsm](doc/fsm.png)

And its state can be (and is) described as:

```ocaml
type container = {
  id : string;
  spec : Spec.t; (* spec as it was provided *)
  created_at : float; (* unix timestamp *)
  stable_at : float option; (* unix timestamp *)
}

type snapshot = | Init
                | Wait of container
                | TryAgain of (Spec.t * float)
                | Stable of container
                | WaitNext of (container * container)
                | TryAgainNext of (container * Spec.t * float)
```

This state can be requested via HTTP API and used to build tools on top of condo.

## Build

You will need OCaml 4.02.3.

    git clone https://github.com/prepor/condo.git
    cd condo
    opam pin add -ny condo .
    opam install -y --deps-only condo
    opam install -y topkg-care
    topkg build
