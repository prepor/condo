Condo is a simple idempotent supervisor for Docker containers. It can be used as
basic brick to build reliable and declarative systems without complex and smart
schedulers like Kubernetes, but in combination with tools like nginx-proxy,
consul-template, docker-.

## Features

* Watch directories and start docker container for each specification inside them
* React to any changes in these directories and specifications (adding, removing
  and updating of specifications)
* Zero downtime deploys with enabled `:After` option. It starts new container *in parallel* with the
  previous one. And stops the previous only after the new one is successfully
  started (including healthchecks)
* Support Healthchecks feature of docker (from 1.12). It considers container as
  Stable only then healthchecks are passed
* Manage persistent state of itself. You can kill -9 condo and start it again,
  everything will be fine
* Expose it state into external storage (e.g. Consul). It can be used for
  monitoring of overall system, higher level orchestration, etc.
* Understand Docker authentification config file (~/.docker/config.json usually)
* Provide http-endpoint to track deploy status of service (/v1/wait_for)
* Nice UI for state of current daemon and all system (if state exposing is enabled) TODO: it's broken now
* Container specification is fully opaque for condo, it has the same format as [docker's remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#create-a-container),
  so there is no additional point of indirection and you can use all docker's
  features (even unreleased)
* Self-bootstrapping and updating. It's even can deploy itself!

## Quickstart

Condo is compiled into native code, but primary distribution method is docker, of course.

Note: you can always see help by executing `docker run prepor/condo:v0.10.1 --help`

Condo uses [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) format to describe specifications. It's human and machine
readable format, with comments and it's extendable.

Let's start nginx by condo:

    mkdir -p /tmp/condo_specs && echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.4-alpine"}}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    docker run -v /tmp/condo_specs:/var/lib/condo -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -ti prepor/condo:v0.10.1

You will see Wait -> Stable logs messages. It means that our container has successfully started.

Now we will try to deploy new version of this image:

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:oops-alpine"} :deploy [:After 5]}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    
Oops, there is a typo and we have error "Tag oops-alpine not found in repository" and current state now is TryAgainNext. Condo will try to deploy this spec untill it is successful or new specification arrives. And note that we've still had running nginx:1.11.5-alpine. It's because we specify `:deploy [:After 5]` option, and new container tries to start in parallel with the previous one.

Let's fix the typo:

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"} :deploy [:After 5]}' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
    
Yep, now it's deployed, the previous container was stopped.

That's, basically, core functionality of condo ;)

## Specification format

Condo watches for *.edn files in all directories defined as PREFIXes via command line interface.

It has only one required parameter `:spec`. It contains docker container
description in a format
of
[docker's remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#create-a-container).
The only required field inside this description is `:Image`.

`:spec` is extended by `:Name` parameter (name of the container)

Optional parameters:
* `:deploy` (default `[:Before]`). Can be `[:Before]` or `[:After n]` where `n`
  is a number of seconds before stopping previous container after the successful start of
  the new one.
* `:health-timeout` in seconds (default 10). It's how long condo will wait for passed
  healthchecks.
* `:stop-timeout` in seconds (default 10). It will be passed into `/stop` docker
  operation. It's how long it will wait before force-stop of container.
  
## HTTP API

See `How it works` for definition of state

* `/v1/state` current state of all instances as json
* `/v1/global_state` current state of all condo instances (if state exposing
  into external storage is configured)
* `/v1/wait_for` wait for the stable state of service in all condo instances. 
  Query params: 
  * `name` name of service
  * `timeout` how long to wait in seconds. Returns 500 after `timeout`
  * `image` which image we are waiting for

## Real-world setups

There are some examples of combining condo with other tools. It proceeds
our Quickstart section.

### consul-template

https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template

We can use consul-template to generate specifications. One of the
nicest properties of this is that we can store current version of the container
inside Consul and dynamically change it for all instances.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:{{key_or_default "/versions/nginx" "1.11.5-alpine"}}"} :deploy [:After 5]}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn.ctmpl

    echo '{:spec {:Name "consul" :Image "consul:v0.7.0"
                  :Cmd ["agent" "-dev" "-client=0.0.0.0"]
                  :HostConfig {:PortBindings {"8500/tcp" [{:HostPort "8500"}]}}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/consul.edn

    echo '{:spec {:Image "prepor/consul-template:0.16.0"
                  :Cmd ["-consul" "consul:8500"
                        "-template" "/specs/nginx.edn.ctmpl:/specs/nginx.edn"]
                  :HostConfig {:Binds ["/tmp/condo_specs:/specs/"]
                               :Links ["consul:consul"]}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/consul_template.edn
         
Now we can deploy nginx via curl! ;)

    curl -XPUT localhost:8500/v1/kv/versions/nginx -d '1.11.4-alpine'
    
We can add this line, for example, to CI and both deploy and undeploy new versions
of application manually or automatically.

You can also do service discovery via ENV variables or support HA postgres
with [patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni).

### nginx-proxy

https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy

Our nginx instances don't expose any ports into host machine, that's why we can
run them in parallel while deploying. With nginx-proxy, we can expose one static port for them.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"
                  :Env ["VIRTUAL_HOST=nginx"]} :deploy [:After 5]}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
          
    echo '{:spec {:Image "jwilder/nginx-proxy:0.4.0"
           :Env ["DEFAULT_HOST=nginx"]
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock"]
                        :PortBindings {"80/tcp" [{:HostPort "8000"}]}}}}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/proxy.edn 
          
Now `curl localhost:8000` sends requests to currently deployed container

### docker-registrator

https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator

Docker registrator registers containers as service in different service discovery
registries, for example, consul.

    echo '{:spec {:Image "nginx:1.11.5-alpine"
                  :HostConfig {:PublishAllPorts true}} :deploy [:After 5]}
          ' > /tmp/condo_specs/nginx.edn
          
    echo '{:spec {:Image "gliderlabs/registrator:v7"
           :Cmd ["consul://localhost:8500"]
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock"]
                        :NetworkMode "host"}}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/registrator.edn 
         
It will register nginx-service which started at random port in consul. Now this
information can be used by some external load balancer.
 
## Self-deploying

Condo supports special specification file -- `self.edn`. After it is updated, condo suspends all other updates and starts new container by this specification, and after that, gracefully stops itself.

Be careful, the format of this specification is different, because it contains only docker-container specification (which is usually inside `:spec keyword`).

Example: 

    echo '{:Image "prepor/condo:v0.10.1"
           :HostConfig {:Binds ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
                                "/tmp/condo_specs:/var/lib/condo"]}}
         ' > /tmp/condo_specs/self.edn


## Best practices

* Define healthchecks. Without it, condo considers container as successfully
  started even if it was crashed in a second
* Use restart strategies. Condo doesn't monitor container after it has successfully
  started. But docker daemon does. You can restart containers by
  `:RestartPolicy` option of `HostConfig`, for example `:RestartPolicy {:Name
  "on-failure"}`
  
## How it works

One of the main reasons why condo exists is because deploy tool should be
simple and understandable by all users. Not sure that anyone really knows what
Kubernetes does in each case (1 500 000 lines of code by the way!). Condo is
basically simple state machine for each service:

![Fsm](doc/fsm.png)

And its state can be described (and it is) as:

```ocaml
type container = {
  id : string;
  spec : Spec.t; (* spec as it was provided *)
  created_at : float; (* unix timestamp *)
  stable_at : float option; (* unix timestamp *)
}

type snapshot = | Init
                | Wait of container
                | TryAgain of (Spec.t * float)
                | Stable of container
                | WaitNext of (container * container)
                | TryAgainNext of (container * Spec.t * float)
```

This state can be requested via HTTP API and can be used to build tools on top
of condo
